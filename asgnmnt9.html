	<h1>COMPUTER</h1>
	<U><a href="go to top">GO TO TOP</a></U>
	<p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithemetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>

	<h4>cpu</h4>
	<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also reffered to as a central processor unit,is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithemetical,logical, and input/output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. The form, design, and implimentation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same. </p>

	<h4>ALU</h4>
	<P>In computing, an arithemetic and logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithematic and logical operations. The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs) accomodate very powerful and very complex ALUs; a single component may contain a nuber of ALUs. </P>
